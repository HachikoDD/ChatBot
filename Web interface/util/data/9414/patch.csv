What is Single State Task Specification?,"A task is specified by states and actions. It needs to specify the state space, initial state, actions or operators, goal test and path cost."
What is completeness?,Completeness: an algorithm is complete if it terminates with a solution when one exists. Admissibility: an algorithm is admissible if it is guaranteed to return an optimal solution whenever a solution exists.
What is time complexity?,"In computer science, the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to differ by at most a constant factor."
What is space complexity?,"Space complexity is a measure of the amount of working storage an algorithm needs. That means how much memory, in the worst case, is needed at any point in the algorithm. As with time complexity, we're mostly concerned with how the space needs grow, in big-Oh terms, as the size N of the input problem grows."
What is optimality?,"In computer science, an algorithm is said to be asymptotically optimal if, roughly speaking, for large inputs it performs at worst a constant factor (independent of the input size) worse than the best possible algorithm."
How to calculate space complexity?,"For calculating the space complexity, we need to know the value of memory used by different type of datatype variables, which generally varies for different operating systems, but the method for calculating the space complexity remains the same."
How to calculate time complexity?,"The time complexity, measured in the number of comparisons, then becomes T(n) = n - 1. In general, an elementary operation must have two properties: There can't be any other operations that are performed more frequently as the size of the input grows."

What is alpha beta pruning?,"Alpha–beta pruning is a search algorithm that seeks to decrease the number of nodes that are evaluated by the minimax algorithm in its search tree. It is an adversarial search algorithm used commonly for machine playing of two-player games (Tic-tac-toe, Chess, Go, etc.). It stops evaluating a move when at least one possibility has been found that proves the move to be worse than a previously examined move. Such moves need not be evaluated further. When applied to a standard minimax tree, it returns the same move as minimax would, but prunes away branches that cannot possibly influence the final decision."

What is probability?,"Probabilistic assertions summarize effects of Laziness: failure to enumerate exceptions, qualifications, etc and Ignorance: lack of relevant facts, initial conditions, etc."
