What are the types of Games in ,"There are two main types? Discrete Games and Continuous, embodied games"
List some examples of Discrete Games,"chess, checkers, go, othello,backgammon, monopoly,bridge, poker, scrabble"
What is the features of chess?,"fully observable, deterministic"
What is the features of checkers?,"fully observable, deterministic"
What is the features of backgammon?,"fully observable, stochastic"
What is the features of monopoly?,"fully observable, stochastic"
What is the features of bridge?,partially observable
What is the features of poker?,partially observable
What is the features of scrabble?,partially observable
"List some examples of Continuous, embodied games Games","robocup soccer, pool (snooker)"
What is Minimax?,"It is a perfect play for deterministic, perfect-information games. Its idea is to choose move to position with highest minimax value = best achievable payoff against best play"
What is the relationship between Minimax and Negamax?,"Minimax assumes that all nodes are evaluated with respect to a fixed player (e.g. White in Chess).If we instead assume that each node is evaluated with respect to the player whose turn it is to move, we get a simpler formulation known as Negamax."
What is Negamax?,Negamax is a algorithm which is similar as Minimax. It assumes that each node is evaluated with respect to the player whose turn it is to move
How to make the search feasible?,There are two ways. don°Øt search to final position; use heuristic evaluation at the leaves or use ¶¡-¶¬ pruning
What does ¶¡ means in ¶¡-¶¬ pruning?,"¶¡ is the best value for us found so far, off the current path"
What does ¶¬ means in ¶¡-¶¬ pruning?,"¶¬ is the best value for opponent found so far, off the current path"
What does ¶¡ and ¶¬ means in ¶¡-¶¬ pruning?,"¶¡ is the best value for us found so far, off the current path. ¶¬ is the best value for opponent found so far, off the current path"
What are the Properties of ¶¡-¶¬?,"¶¡-¶¬ pruning is guaranteed to give the same result as minimax, but speeds up the computation substantially. With °∞perfect ordering,°± time complexity = O(b^m/2)"
What is expectimax?,Expectimax is an adaptation of Minimax which also handles chance nodes.
