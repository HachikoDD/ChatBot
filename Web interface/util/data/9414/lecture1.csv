Why prolog?,Prolog is very useful for AI and search. It is good for you to see an example of a non-imperative language. logic programming languages like Prolog have recently had a resurgence of popularity in the computing industry

What is the relation between AI and Philosophy?,Mind is like a machine. it operates on knowledge encoded in an “internal language”. thought and reasoning can be used to arrive at the right actions
What is the relation between AI and Mathematics?,It is tools to manipulate logical statements and manipulate probabilistic statements. It has dynamical systems and RNNs.
What is the relation between AI and Psychology?,humans and animals are information processing machines
What is the relation between AI and Linguistics?,language use fits into the ‘information processing machine’ model. It has Chomsky hierarchy and natural language processing
What is the relation between AI and Engineering?,build computers and robots fast enough to make AI applications and simulation possible. links to mechanical engineering
What is the relation between AI and Neurobiology?,"Molecular level, single cell recording, cell circuit level, information processing in biological systems"
What is the relation between AI and Neurology?,Drugs. Learning from disorders and brain scans.

What is Turing test?,Turing thought a computer would pass this test by end of the 20th century. The Loebner Prize (Turing test) competition is held each year. The “Total Turing Test” allows physical objects to be passed to the machines as well as characters via the teletype.
Who proposed the tuning test?,It is proposed by Alan Turing in 1950
What is the aim of Turing test?,the aim is for the computer to imitate a human well enough to fool the human interrogator
What are the critiques of Turing test?,Misplaced emphasis on abstract reasoning rather than low-level perception and behaviour
Is there any critiques to Turing test?,"Yes, misplaced emphasis on abstract reasoning rather than low-level perception and behaviour"
